Lift.h — your own C library

Makefile allows to more easily write our build system, and conditional compiled what need to be recompiled because it has been modified.  

Built systems goals are to 

1. organize the magical incantations: automate the compilation and linking of source files into executables. This is really important in a project. The way Developers build source code is important

2. recompile only the changes portion of the source code and the portion dependent on changed code 

3. Build system should be a programming language that allows you to avoid redundant copied code 


Build Rules

Example: 
all: <—— build rule
$(BINARY) <—— the target of the build rule
