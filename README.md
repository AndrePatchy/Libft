Libft involves learning how the standard functions of C programming work by writing them from scratch and creating a personal library. This project is vital as the library will be used in future assignments at 42. You can find the subject [here](https://github.com/AndrePatchy/Libft/blob/main/Subject/en_subject_libft.pdf). 
In every project, I write down a few notes for mental model purposes. You can find the notes that helped me with the Libft project [here](https://github.com/AndrePatchy/Libft/blob/main/Support.txt).
